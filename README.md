# SocialSpace

### Description
A social media site created in Django using CodeWithTomi's tutorial. It's not just a complete copy of Tomi's tutorial though, I added my own stuff to it as well!

You can sign up, create an account and login. You can customize your aspects of your profile, such as your profile pic, bio, first name, last name and country. And you can post images, videos, or embedded YouTube videos to the site, with a caption!

### Install Instructions

Make sure you have Django installed, then copy the repo and run `python manage.py runserver`
